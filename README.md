# MATLAB & Simulink Practice Repository

I started learning MATLAB and Simulink in May 2023 by completing MathWorks Onramp self-paced study courses, Motorsport Engineer Network courses, and through my own practice. This repository is therefore home to various practice projects completed in my personal time with the aim of developing my MATLAB and Simulink skills.

Some of the projects and work captured in this repository may eventually be transferred to my other projects on race strategy or control system modelling if appropriate.

Current developments include:
- [Formula 1 Las Vegas Strategy GP Strategy Modelling](https://github.com/TomWebster98/MATLAB-Simulink-Practice/blob/main/Las_Vegas_Strategy_Model/README.md)
- [Strategy optimisation problem practice application](https://github.com/TomWebster98/MATLAB-Simulink-Practice/tree/main/Strategy_Optimiser_Practice)

For real F1 race strategy analysis, see my repository [here](https://github.com/TomWebster98/Race-Strategy-Analysis)
